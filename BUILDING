==Linux==
To compile on Linux:

gcc -Wall -ggdb -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -lfuse -I/usr/include/mysql -L/usr/lib/mysql \
  -I/usr/include/fuse -lmysqlclient -o dfuse dfuse.c

Note that on CentOS, you'll need a newer version of the kernel than what may have come on
your machine.

==Mac OS X==
To build on Mac OS X:

gcc -D__DARWIN_64_BIT_INO_T=0 -I/usr/local/include/fuse -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -ggdb \
  -I/usr/local/mysql/include -D__FreeBSD__=10 -lfuse -L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient \
  -o dfuse dfuse.c

On early 2011 Macs, which use a 64-bit kernel, you'll need a 64-bit version of the
FUSE kext.  Finding that is left as an exercise for the reader.  Depending on how you
installed MySQL, you may also need to run:

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/mysql/lib/"
